- Hi this is my first code - which i would upload to git hub..
lets see how it works !!
-- I was sucessfully able to upload the code to git hub..
still trying to learn other available commands for practice..
i would keep posted further updates !!

------------------------------------------------------------------------
I've created a new brach which has this file by default - as whenever we create any new branch from master branch or any branch new branch would get all last code..

so all below text I'm creating for branch1 - and I would merge it with master\main branch, lets see how it works !!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, I was sucessfully able to merge the code\DATA from branch1 to main branch.. and it worked..
also able to sucessfully push all latest code to git hub...
there are still few more steps\commnds i would need to test and for that i may need to watch the videos again..
---- here is the summary what we have done so far----

- installed the git on linux machine.. sudo yum install git
- created  the repo on git hub.
- created the dir with same name on linux machine and executed git init commnad.
- configre the remote repo with local git - git remote add origin (exact Git repo URL)
- clone the remote repo with local git
- created file locally and added it to staging area and commited it and push it to git hub for testing.
- modeifiled the file and perfom the same steps again and it worked and can see modifed content on remote repo
- created branch - modifiled the code - mearge it with main branch and push it to git hub - it worked as well..
